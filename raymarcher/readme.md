# raytracing/raymarcher

## Running
This project has only been built with g++ 7.3.0 for Windows. No guarantees for other compilers.

If you are on windows, compile the executable with
```sh
g++ main.cpp
```

Then, run the executable with
```sh
./a.exe
```

This will take a little bit (a few minutes). It does use about 100% of your CPU.
